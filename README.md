# Awescores

Awescores is a WordPress starter theme that's based on the great work done by Automattic and all the contributors over at [underscores.me](https://underscores.me/)

Underscores is a great starting place for beginning to develop a custom WordPress theme, but I found there were a handful of things I added on almost all of my client websites. This project is designed to save me time for the types of sites I have been building, but if you find the additional features useful, feel free to use it for your own projects.

This is not meant to be a polished theme, or even a parent theme. It is meant to be hacked and modified just like the original underscores project.

## Additional Features

Additional Features in Awescores that are not included in underscores:

* Added Widgetized Footer area
* Basic header layout with flexbox
* Include Font Awesome Free icons as a webfont 
* Added JS to close small menu when user clicks outside of it
* Added SASS variables for colors, typography, break point, etc.
* Removed sidebar on single Pages and adjust layout conditionally
* Minor style improvements (margins, padding, etc.)

## Future Development

I will continue to add new features to this theme as it saves me repetitive tasks upon starting new projects. However, I do want to keep this project's scope broad so it can be used as a jumping off point for any type of site. For more specific features and styles, I plan to build those out separately as the need arises.

Periodically I will review the underscores repository for important or security-related updates that need to be implemented.

## readme.txt

Look for additional information, including WordPress headers and version information, in: `awescores/readme.txt`
